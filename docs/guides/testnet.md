# Testnet

The testnet is a test environment for FNB Chain network, run by the FNB Chain development community, which is open to developers.

The validators on the testnet are from development team.

You can connect a node to the testnet by downloading the [node binary](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix) to use this [configuration](https://github.com/githubusername/githubrepo/node-binary/tree/master/fullnode/testnet/0.6.3-hotfix/config).

There is also a [web wallet](https://testnet-explorer.finanscan.io/en/) that can directly interact with the DEX. testnet.

## What is the testnet good for?

- Create your test address and get your testnet funds.
- Develop applications and try tutorials on FNB Chain without the potential to lose your own assets.
- Test your applications against new versions of FNB Chain.
- Analyze blockchain data on a smaller, non-trivial data set compared to the public network.
