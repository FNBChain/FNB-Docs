# FNB Chain

## What is FNB Chain?

FNB Chain brings EVM-compatible programmability and native cross-chain communication with FNB Chain using an innovative consensus of [Proof of Authority(PoA)](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md)

## Why is FNB Chain designed as a separate chain from FNB Chain?

The execution of a Smart Contract may slow down the exchange function and add non-deterministic factors to trading. Even if that compromise could be tolerated, it might be a straightforward idea to introduce a new Virtual Machine specification based on Tendermint, based on the current underlying consensus protocol and major RPC implementation of FNB Chain. But all these will increase the learning requirements for all existing dApp communities, and will not be very welcomed.

## How does FNB Chain work? What is the architecture and consensus used?

FNB Chain relies on a system with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.

There will be fewer validators on FNB Chain testnet.

## Can you tell more about Proof of Staked Authority(PoSA)? What is it?

[PoSA](../../smart-chain/guides/concepts/consensus.md) is a combination of PoA and PoS. Blocks are produced by a limited set of validators, they are elected in and out based on a staking based governance. Validators take turns to produce blocks in a PoA manner

## What are the benefits for developers to build on FNB Chain?

* EVM-compatible: FNB Chain supports all the existing Ethereum tooling
Fast block time, cheaper cost
* Native cross-chain trasfer & communication: FNB DEX remains a liquid venue of exchange of assets on FNB Chain and FNB Chain"

## What are the benefits for developers to build on FNB Chain?

FNB Chain opens the gate for users to take advantage of the fast transferring and trading

## What make FNB Chain different?

Key Innovations:

* Proof-of-authority Consensus

* Native Cross-Chain Communication

* Expand the use cases of FNB token

## FNB Chain is EVM-compatible. What does that mean?

EVM means Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any smart-contract written to run in EVM can be easily ported to FNB Chain.

## Can developers make hybrid Dapps using both FNB Chain and FNB Chain in one single Dapp?

Yes, with the help of native cross-chain functions
